                    <p>11 Months after the final battle which put the nail on the coffin for the Circum-Pacific War.</p>

                    <p>The Razgriz Team went on their separate ways, Snow went to become The Head of Pilot instructor at the Air Force Academy in Oured, Osea. He also Had taken Grimm under his wing to became a pilot instructor. Whilst Blaze and Kei Nagase became a Co-Leading Flight Research team and a flight tester at St. Ulfred Air Base Research Center located at the northwest Osean mainland, although they were working at the same workplace, they rarely met each other due their separate work time and expertise.</p>
                    <p>The four heroes met again after a long time to visit their best friend and a wingmate's grave for an annual visit. Captain Alvin H Davenport, Also known as "Chopper" was Killed in action on one of the battle they fought. After the visit, Snow had to leave first due to some businesses he needs to take care of, the other three had a lunch together and chatted.</p>
                    <p>"How's the students there? " Asked Blaze to Grimm</p>
                    <p>"It's one thing to teach a Nugget who can barely control their plane, but it's another thing to teach a 'Pre-Nugget' , they're some innocent kid who've only seen war through television" Grimm answered with a slight exhausted look on his face</p>
                    <p>"Yeah, I see what you mean there" Blaze answered with a small laugh.</p>
                    <p>"So, how about you two? Had a marriage plan already?" Asked Grimm while laughing.</p>
                    <p>"H-hey, not that kind of question! "Said blaze as they both laughed and Nagase smiled</p>
                    <p>"But I was serious tho, don't you want to go a step bit further? " Grimm asked with a serious-like face.</p>
                    <p>"Well... I do have a plan, but.... I got a job, Kei as well. We're in the same workplace but we rarely meet each other, crazy right?! ...... I mean, sure, Kei has far less working hours, but stillâ€¦.." Blaze with a slight annoyed face.</p>
                    <p>"Well, Nagase, why don't you quit? Surely Your "husband's" work is paying well"</p>
                    <p>"Ha ha, nah, that's not the case, I just love being able to fly and wanted to feel it as if it was my reward, you know? " Nagase Smiled</p>
                    <p>"Well, if that's your choice" Grimm followed</p>
                    <p>"Don't worry grimm, I won't let anyone snatch her from me, even if it's her work, ha ha ha"</p>
                    <p>They all laugh, but... Nagase couldn't help but hide her face, as if she was holding a secret. Of course, Blaze, who had been with her for a long time, noticed it.</p>
                    <p>"You alright Kei? you seem on edge...... no pun intended" Asked Blaze feeling concerned with Kei</p>
                    <p>"Oh, It's nothing, the weather feels pretty hot today"</p>
                    <p>"Oh.... I see" Blaze was not too convinced with her response.</p>
